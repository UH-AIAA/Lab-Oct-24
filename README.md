# Lab-Oct-24
At home material included!

Feel free to look ahead [here](https://github.com/UH-AIAA/Lab-Oct-31/blob/main/README.md) -- it would be sick if everyone had looked or worked through this by lab _next_ week :)

Forgot to save my changes before lab -- today we will go over testing, packaging, and releasing!
